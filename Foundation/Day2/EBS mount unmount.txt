First We created one volume: EBS
	created one volume with size 16GB
	sperate volume which I can use for 1 instance as well as multiple instances
	
	while creating volume make sure you select proper zone

2. attach the volume to your instance so basically we are increasing the size of our instance

	select volume --> actions --> attach volume --> select instance --> give the device name like /dev/sdb etc..

3. I want to see this attached volume 

	open instance and check in storage direct one

4. How to open it and check it in aws Linux console?

	open instance --> connect -->  in cmd

	1. lsblk : to see all volumes available to your running instance
	
	2. how to see the particular volume is empty or not: sudo file -s /dev/xvda
		(if its showing data means its empty directory)

	3. let's mount some folder to your volume

		sudo mkdire /hello
		sudo mount /dev/xvda /hello
		(if it is mounted successfully you can check)
		lsblk

		(you can see that folder attached to that particular volume)

	4. for unmount:
                       sudo umount /data

	(once the attachment was done reboot instance for mounting some directories)
